# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: February 20, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I've worked through Either in fantasyland spec and a few git issues and bash commands.

**Thoughts** All that reading was good but the main challenge is to think in the functional way instead of refactoring it from imperative way.
